# binaryClock
a binary clock with an alternative display

## How to read?
The first column shows the hours, the second the minutes and the third the seconds (read from left to right),
an unfilled circle symbolizes a 0, a filled circle a 1.
now you can read the number inside the column from top to bottom.
###Example
first column: 01010 = 10
second column: 101111 = 47
third column: 100001 = 33

so it's 10:47:33.

The time is displayed in 24-hour format. A version with a 12-hour format may follow.
